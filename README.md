# Object-Oriented Programming Course Assignment #3

## Authors: Kfir Goldfarb and Nadav Keysar

This assignment have two parts:

###### Part 1:

Build directed weighted graph data structure, and graph algorithms class for the directed and wighted graphs.

###### Part 2:

By part 1 graph data structure and graph algorithms build a client class that know how to play the best in pokemon game on the directed weighted graph (the game is work on a server called Ex2_Server_v0.13.jar - can see in libs folder), every interaction with the server is doing by json formats, the server can get a game level [from 0 to 23] and an ID of the student, and can build random directed weighted graph with some pokemon on his edges, the Ex2 class will do some inserting manipulations on the given graph and with the DWGraph_Algo class will use some algorithms in it aka shortestPathDist, shortestPath, isConnected and more (details below).
